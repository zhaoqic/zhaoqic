# Hello there, fellow code traveler! 👋

I'm **Zhaoqi 'ZQ' Cheng**! But, most folks in the physical world just call me ZQ. 🚀

I'm currently traversing the intricate halls of knowledge as a PhD candidate at the Questrom School of Boston University. 🏛️🎓

At the moment, I'm crafting, debugging, and optimizing in the [BIT Lab](https://www.leedokyun.com/bitlab.html). 🧪🔬

## What's cooking in your lab? 🥼

Well, I'm glad you asked! I'm tinkering around with NLP and econometric models, trying to cook up some interpretable representations of multimodal contents that are deemed "creative". 🎨

I'm particularly excited about using generative models to characterize patent filings, digging deep into firm innovation strategies, and exploring the antitrust implications of mergers and acquisitions in nascent technological areas. 👨‍🔬📈

## But why, ZQ? 🤔

Because I believe in the potential and power of technology, its economic impact, and its role in society. I'm keen on making sense of the tech world and making it accessible and meaningful for everyone. 🌍

## Can we connect? 🤝

Absolutely! I'd love to collaborate, brainstorm, or simply geek out over some coffee (virtual or real ☕). You can find me [here](https://zqcheng.com). 

Remember, the code is strong with this one! 😉 

May the force be with you, and happy coding! 💻🚀
